# Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting

## Business Problem

Retailers struggle to estimate future demand accurately.
Overestimating leads to excess inventory and wasted cost.
Underestimating leads to stock shortages and lost revenue.

This project builds a machine learning model to forecast daily sales for Rossmann stores
using historical sales data, store characteristics, and promotional information.
The goal is to give store managers and planners a reliable demand signal they can act on.

## Dataset

**Source:** [Rossmann Store Sales — Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales)

| File | Rows | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| train.csv | 1,017,209 | Daily sales per store (2013–2015) |
| store.csv | 1,115 | Store-level attributes |
| test.csv | 41,088 | Stores and dates to predict |

**Target variable:** `Sales` — daily revenue per store

## Key Findings from EDA

Before building any model, the data revealed several strong business patterns:

- **Promotions drive 81% higher sales** (7,991 avg with promo vs 4,406 without)
- **December peaks 24% above the yearly average** — clear holiday seasonality
- **Store type B outperforms all others** with average sales of 10,231 vs ~6,900 for types A, C, D
- **Monday and Sunday are the strongest trading days** (~8,200 avg); Saturday is weakest (5,875)
- **Easter and Christmas state holidays** drive the highest single-day sales (~9,700–9,900)
- **172,817 closed-store days** were identified and excluded from analysis — a critical data quality step

## Data Cleaning Summary

| Column | Issue | Strategy |
|--------|-------|----------|
| CompetitionDistance | 3 missing (0.27%) | Filled with median (2,325m) |
| CompetitionOpenSinceMonth/Year | 354 missing (31.75%) | Filled with 0 — no competitor data |
| Promo2SinceWeek/Year | 544 missing (48.79%) | Filled with 0 — stores not in Promo2 scheme |
| PromoInterval | 544 missing (48.79%) | Filled with "None" — stores not in Promo2 scheme |
| Open=1, Sales=0 | 54 rows (0.01%) | Dropped — likely data entry errors |

**Clean dataset:** 844,338 rows × 18 columns, zero missing values
Saved to `data/processed/train_clean.csv`

## Evaluation Metric

**RMSPE — Root Mean Square Percentage Error**

The competition metric penalises percentage errors rather than absolute ones,
which treats a 10% miss on a small store equally to a 10% miss on a large store.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.13
- pandas, numpy
